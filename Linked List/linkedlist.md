# Linked List

### Why should I learn linked list?
- Linked list trains how to think in pointer, memory, and trade-offs. 
- Array hide memory, linked list expose it.
- Start thinking in references / next pointer
- This mindset essential for Trees, Graphs, Tries, LRU caches, Low-level system thinking 
- Arrays optimize for access
- Linked list optimize for structural change

### How is linked list diffrent from array?

| Dimension              | Array      | Linked List            |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Memory layout          | Contiguous | Non-contiguous         |
| Access by index        | O(1)       | O(n)                   |
| Insert/delete (middle) | O(n)       | O(1)*                  |
| Memory overhead        | Low        | Higher (extra pointer) |
| Cache friendly         | Yes        | No                     |
| Resizing               | Expensive  | Natural                |

### Minimum need to learn
- Node structure
- Insert (head, tail, middle)
- Delete
- Reverse
- Fast & slow pointer
- Cycle detection
